A Friend of mine wanted to add a Bot to his DiscordServer for creating DnD-Events

This is a simple Discord-bot to create events and get notifications from the Bot if the event is in a specified time range, can be changed in the .env file. You can delete events and with a set role you can also use commands for the pm2 to restart the bot from afar or to stop it.

A new feature is the embed Reply. you can choose whenever you want a basic text-reply or a embed reply.

Most Messages can be changed in the .env file. More incoming.

The bot includes a Sqlite3 filebased Database to store Events. The Events will be deleted automatical after they expired.
