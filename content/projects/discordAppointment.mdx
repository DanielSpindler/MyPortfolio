Like Many others i just wanted to create a Simple Bot to see how the Discord API works.

## Getting Started

    ### Prerequisites
    Added a Discordbot via the discord page to your server so that u have a discord-bot-Token

    node v18.x

    ### Installation

    1. Clone the repo
       ```ts
       git clone https://github.com/DanielSpindler/discord-bot.git
       ```
    2. Install NPM packages
          ```ts
          npm install
          ```
    3. copy .env-example and name it .env & edit it after
       ```bash
       as instructed in the .env
       ```
    4. Run
       ```ts
        node index.js
       ```

    ## Usage

    After the Bot will greet everyone in the channel and you can type "help" to see a list of the commands

    right now you can add & delete notifications.
